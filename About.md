**Machine Learning Model For Heart Failure Survival Predictions** 

This project utilizes machine learning to predict heart failure survival. The goal was to develop a robust machine learning predictive model using NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow that leverages features like serum creatinine, ejection fraction, age, anemia, and diabetes, to assist in early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases.

**Objective:**
The main objective of the project is to create a predictive model that can accurately assess the likelihood of mortality by heart failure based on the provided dataset. By doing so, the model can potentially assist in the early detection and management of individuals at high risk of cardiovascular diseases, providing a valuable tool for healthcare practitioners.

**Significance:**
Given that cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of global mortality, the development of an effective predictive model holds significant implications for public health. Early identification of individuals at risk can enable timely intervention and management, potentially preventing or mitigating the impact of heart failure.

**Features and Data:**
The dataset includes 12 features, encompassing both physiological indicators (such as serum creatinine and ejection fraction) and demographic/health-related factors (including age, anemia, and diabetes). These features serve as the input variables for the machine learning model, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships that can be indicative of the likelihood of survival or mortality in patients with heart failure.

**Population-wide Strategies:**
The project aligns with the broader goal of addressing cardiovascular diseases through population-wide strategies. By incorporating machine learning into the early detection and management processes, the project aims to contribute to preventive healthcare measures. This approach is particularly relevant for individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or existing cardiovascular disease.

**Technical Approach:**
The technical approach involves using machine learning algorithms, likely classification models, to train on the provided dataset. The model will learn from the relationships between the input features and the survival outcomes, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data. The model's performance will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and possibly the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

In summary, the project leverages machine learning to create a predictive model that can assist in the early detection of heart failure mortality, contributing to the broader goal of preventing cardiovascular diseases through targeted and data-driven healthcare strategies.
